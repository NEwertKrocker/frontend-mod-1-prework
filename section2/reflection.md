## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I *think* that I'm pretty good about knowing when to ask questions. As a longtime teacher, I've had many students who struggled to ask for help when they needed it -- and I've also had students who wouldn't stop tossing questions out there without stopping to puzzle it over themselves first. I have been trying to coach myself to Google things myself if I'm just curious, but I confess that I know instructors like to see engaged students, and I'm not above asking a clarifying question to try and convey that I'm listening and thinking actively! I DO, however, want to give the impression that I'm competent and independent... hopefully those two opposing impulses will even out to asking questions enough, but not too often.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

Because I've kept pretty robust notes thus far, it's easy to go back and make reference to them if I need to.
Having to Google for answers isn't difficult yet, because we're still doing very basic stuff. I appreciate that
the scaffolding is being pulled away at a reasonable pace.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statement is an if/then consideration, in which you evaluate what to do based on certain criteria.
A real life example: my 3-year-old comes to me with a "booboo." If this booboo is a scratch or a scrape, and
has broken the skin, I might apply a band-aid. If it is milder than that, a band-aid might not do any good (except for providing emotional reassurance, which is of course valuable).
A web-site example: Lots of different websites check to see if you're a registered user before offering you various
menu options. That's got to be a conditional statement: "if registeredUser, offer menu options" else "redirect to
Create Account screen," or something similar.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

Because you can chain `else if` commands, you can allow the computer to check through a series of conditions in order to decide how to proceed. The program runs through each condition in turn until it finds a true value, otherwise it outputs the final `else` command.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

That's what logical operators are for! They let you add AND and OR modifiers to your `if`/`else` statements.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I'm still a little befuddled about the different commands for working in the console versus a
webpage. The Duckett text uses `document.write` instead of `console.log`, and while I understand there's
a difference between the two, I'm not deep enough into things yet to really process the different contexts.
