## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

Some of the things mentioned here already play to my strengths. I read a lot, for instance, and as a teacher for 12+ years, I obviously understand the benefits of teaching others on subject retention. (How much did I learn as a result of all the teaching prep I've had to do over the years?) I feel like I'm pretty healthy in my perspective on learning as a journey and the benefits of being adaptable. (I think I have a "growth mindset," too, even if that particular phrase has always struck me as a little too entrepreneurial for my tastes.)

I think I probably need to take the final two suggestions to heart, though. I've never been able to internalize the rhythm of Pomodoro, for instance, and so as a result, my focus and energy tend to flag long before I allow myself to take a break. Also, I have a weakness for sweets, and so I'm probably not doing my brain any favors with my diet.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

A String is a data type which handles strings of characters. Used for all kinds of text, and enclosed by single or double quotation marks. (A number or series of numbers can also make up a string, if they're denoted as such by the quotations.)

A Number is a data type which handles numbers, including negative numbers and decimals (which are called "floating point numbers.").

Booleans are binary - either "true" or "false", and are useful for yes/no situations or other black and white scenarios.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("'Hello World!'");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Code comments can be portioned out either by double slashes (//) in the case of a single-line comment, or asterisks within slashes (/* */) in the case of multi-line comments. It's good etiquette to others (and probably very useful to yourself) to explain bits of code in plain language, so that others (or your future self) has an idea exactly what you're trying to do in a given bit of code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable is a bit of data which, once declared, can have a value which is, well, variable! This is fundamentally necessary for doing all kinds of logical work in code. You can assign a value to a variable, update that value, and make the value dependent upon other statements.

To my six-year-old son, I might say: "A variable is an idea that can mean different things in different situations. If I wanted 'height' to be a variable, that would be different if we were talking about you, your sister, or Mommy. It could be something other than a number, though -- if I wanted 'favorite color' to be a variable, it might be blue, red, green, mauve, whatever!"

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Let's say Twitter, for instance. I imagine that the content of a tweet is a string, the number of likes a
tweet has is a number, and whether an account is locked or public is probably a Boolean value.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is the process of joining various data types together using the + modifier. Using it, we can
put several strings (and/or numbers) together. "Type Coercion" means that if we mix data types when concatenating, we'll probably end up with a string as the output.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

If I order pizza using the Dominos app, as I can admit to doing on occasion, I imagine the text I am greeted with
upon logging in is some variant on ("Welcome back, " + firstName + "!")

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I'm still confused about how to include Booleans in concatenation, as I presume I'd need to create some sort of if/else statement to offer two different strings based on the variable's value.
