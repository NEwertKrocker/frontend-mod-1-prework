## Array Methods

`pop` -

The `pop` method returns the final element in an array and then removes that element from the array,
shortening the array by 1.

`push` -

The `push` method adds more elements to the end of an array and then returns the new length of the array.

`shift` -

`shift` seems to be the inverse of `pop`: it returns the *first* element in an array and then
removes that element from the array.

`unshift` -

`unshift` works like the inverse of `push`: it adds new elements to the *beginning* of an array,
and then returns the length of the array.
