## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I really jive with the notion that you should be seeking out challenges which lie within your Zone of Proximal Development (which is a term that I'd heard before, but hadn't been thinking about it -- despite the fact that
I've been telling my six-year-old all the time that he should be trying things which are "hard but
not impossible" if he wanted to get better at something).

I also appreciate the reassurance that people who write code need to be comfortable with challenges,
because I think that's a mental block that I've had about the idea of coding for a long time.
"I could never code," I thought to myself, "because I could never keep all those logical dependencies
in my brain simultaneously." Now, of course, I am trying to remind myself that (A) even experienced
coders have to be referencing things constantly and (B) you don't have to hold it all in your mind,
because it's all written down, because that's literally what code is. I'm trying to get in a mindset of
"Okay, let's try and build it and see how close we can get, even if it doesn't end up being perfect."

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I think I have a Growth Mindset in terms of setting measurable, reasonable, timely goals, and also in terms of constantly looking for new things to learn. I think I still struggle with what I highlighted above -- telling
myself that I need to be ambitious and tackle the challenge even if I can't yet envision how to complete it.
I need to remind myself that the process of attempting something difficult will necessarily involve learning
along the way.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

I use an app called "Goal Streaks" to keep track of each day that I put in my cardio.
It's a simple program that just puts an X on a calendar for each day you tell it to,
and it keeps a tally of how long your streak is. I imagine that the dates might be
stored as an array, and the program could run a simple `if/else` check to see if
you've flagged the task as completed. (And then, of course, print the length of the
array to tell you how long your streak is.)

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

An array method is sort of like a function for altering the contents of an array. The ones we've learned
so far have returned elements from an array and then removed those elements, or else added new
elements from an array.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

A loop is a way to run a chunk of code several times, such as for each element in an array.
You might want to use a loop if you need to run a check of some kind on each element in an
array. Loops are also useful when you need to run up a counter or otherwise increment data.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

A loop is a set of instructions, like a recipe, that you can follow many times. You can tell
the loop where to start, when to finish, and even in which direction to go! Sometimes, like in
a factory, you want to do the same motions over and over to many different products. A loop is
a way to tell a computer to do that.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I accidentally watched too far in the loop/array video and saw the introduction to using loops
on objects, so now of course my head is swimming with how THAT might be implemented. I also am
having a hard time trying to think about how loops will be implemented on larger, more complex
tasks than the ones we're given in these problems, but I'm hopeful that once I'm asked to
tackle such problems, it'll become clear to me in the process of implementing it.
